# Clearpath — build notes

Kept as the work happens, not reconstructed afterwards.

## Core learning artifacts

1. **RBAC with sensitivity tiers** — two classes of clinical note with
   different, deliberately asymmetric rules.
2. **Recurring dual-resource scheduling with a conditional resource** — clinician
   + room, except telehealth needs no room.
3. **Scored dynamic forms with risk thresholds** — versioned templates, scoring
   rules that version with them, critical items that alert regardless of total.
4. **Two-tier notes with supervisory co-signature.**
5. **The superbill** — a claim document assembled entirely from records that
   already existed, and honest about the one it cannot supply.

## 1. RBAC with sensitivity tiers

**The problem.** Access in a counseling practice is not a ladder. A supervisor
outranks an associate on the official record — they must co-sign it — and has
*less* access than that associate to the associate's private process notes,
where the answer is never. A practice manager administers the whole business and
cannot read a session note without breaking glass, and cannot read a process note
even then. Any model where "more senior" implies "sees more" gets this wrong.

**The design.** One declarative `MATRIX: role × resource × action → rule`. Cells
absent from the matrix deny. Rules are five named predicates over the actor and
the *relationships* of the thing being touched (`author`, `authorOrSupervisor`,
`supervisorOfAuthor`, `treating`, `breakGlass`); relationships are resolved from
data by the caller, so reassigning an associate's supervisor in the database
immediately reroutes both read access and the co-sign queue with no code change.

Two decisions worth naming:

- **`process_note` and `progress_note` are separate resources, not one resource
  with a sensitivity flag.** A flag invites `if (note.private)` checks scattered
  across call sites; separate resources put the difference in the policy table
  where it is visible and testable. The supervisor's row reads
  `progress_note: { cosign: ... }` next to `process_note: { read: 'author' }` —
  the asymmetry is legible at a glance.
- **`can()` returns a `Decision`, not a boolean.** It carries which rule fired
  and whether the actor was in a break-glass session, because the audit log
  needs both, and denials must be logged as richly as grants. A boolean would
  have forced every call site to re-derive that context.

**Front desk is modelled by resource, not by field.** "Sees the calendar but not
why anyone is there" could be a field-level projection on a client record; it is
instead separate resources (`client` vs `form_submission`, `form_request` vs
`form_submission`, `attendance_history` split out from `client`). Field-level
redaction is a filter you can forget to apply. A missing matrix cell is a 403.

**What it does not do.** No hierarchy, no role inheritance, no per-record ACLs,
no delegation. `associate` and `therapist` share an identical matrix — the
co-signature requirement is a workflow gate in the note state machine, not a
permission — and modelling it as a permission would have been the intuitive
wrong answer.

**Test approach.** All 330 cells are enumerated and asserted, but the expected
policy is hand-written from the PRD rather than read back off the matrix, so the
suite cannot agree with a wrong edit. Each cell is probed three ways: an actor
holding every relationship *and* break-glass, an actor who supervises the author
but wrote nothing, and an actor with no relationship at all. That last probe is
what proves which permissions are unconditional.

## 2. Recurring dual-resource scheduling with a conditional resource

**The problem.** A counseling practice runs on standing appointments: the same
client, the same clinician, the same hour, every week, for months. Each instance
needs a clinician *and* a therapy room, reserved together or not at all — except
when it does not, because a telehealth session needs no room and must not be
blocked by a full room map. So: recurrence, two resources, one of them
conditional, and no double-booking of either.

**The design.**

*Booking is decided by Postgres, not by application code.* Two `EXCLUDE USING
gist` constraints — one on `(clinicianId, tstzrange(startAt, endAt))`, one on
`(roomId, …)`, both filtered to non-cancelled rows — make the insert itself the
check. Room selection is then optimistic: pick a candidate, insert, and on a
room collision (`23P01`) try the next room; on a *clinician* collision stop,
because there is no second clinician to fall through to. A read-then-write
availability check cannot be made safe against a concurrent booking of the last
room, and every attempt to make it safe just moves the window. The race suite
puts ten simultaneous bookings against four rooms and asserts exactly four
commit.

*The conditional resource is a database invariant.* A `CHECK` constraint says
in-person requires a room and telehealth forbids one. It is not an application
habit that a future endpoint can forget.

*Recurrence stores local wall time, never a UTC instant plus seven days.* A
standing Tuesday 3pm is 3pm in March and 3pm in November. Patterns hold a
weekday and minutes-from-midnight; each occurrence converts separately through a
two-pass zoned conversion. `src/time.test.ts` asserts the hour either side of
both DST transitions, and the scheduling suite asserts it again through the
database.

**The bug worth writing down.** Idempotency first keyed on the date the
appointment sits on. Every test passed. Then: reschedule an instance from
Tuesday to Thursday, run the horizon again, and the planner sees an unfilled
Tuesday and books over the slot the client just moved out of. The unique index
on the occurrence key caught it — which is the index doing its job and the
planner failing at its own.

The fix was to separate two things the first design had conflated: **the slot in
the series an instance fills** (fixed at creation, recovered from the occurrence
key) and **where the appointment currently is** (whatever a reschedule made it).
Idempotency keys on the first; withdrawal-on-pattern-change looks at the second.

**What it does not do.** No arbitrary RRULE — weekly and biweekly are what a
practice actually books, and a full recurrence grammar would be a week spent on
a case nobody has. No automatic rescheduling around a clinician's absence: that
produces a work-list for a person, because moving somebody's standing hour is a
conversation, not a write.

## 3. Scored forms with versioned rules and risk thresholds

**The problem.** Intake, consent and screeners are data, so a practice manager
can revise them without a deploy. But a screener that has been answered is a
clinical record: revising the instrument must not re-score or re-render what
somebody already completed. And a screener can contain a question whose answer
needs a clinician *today*, whatever the total says.

**The design.** A submission binds to a template *version*, and publishing a
revision creates a new row rather than mutating the old one. There is
deliberately no edit-in-place: that is the single operation that would silently
rewrite history. Scoring rules version with the template, so a v1 response is
always scored by v1 rules.

Two independent paths to review:

- **Thresholds** on the total, with the practice's concern line marked `alert`.
- **Critical items**, which flag regardless of total. Somebody can answer every
  other question at zero, score 1, land in the "minimal" band, and still need a
  call. A design where severity is a single number cannot express that, which is
  why the two paths are separate rather than one weighted score.

A flagged submission raises **one alert to one person** — the treating clinician
— in the same transaction as the submission itself. A scored screener that
half-saved is a client who answered a question about self-harm into a void.

**Reason codes, never content.** The scorer emits `critical:item_9`, not the
answer and not the score. Those strings travel to the alert, the review queue
and the audit log, so anything readable in them is effectively published to
every surface that shows a flag. The wording a clinician reads is assembled at
the very edge, in the alerts page, and is never stored or logged.

**Conditional fields resolve by repeated passes**, so a field revealed by
another conditional field disappears when its parent does. A single-pass filter
leaves orphans visible, which is how a form ends up demanding an answer to a
question it is no longer showing. Only visible fields are scored, so a branch
the client opened and then closed cannot inflate a risk score — and the server
rejects an answer to a hidden question outright, because the form is a trust
boundary.

**Retired questions keep their answers.** Rendering a v1 submission against v2
surfaces them as labelled orphans rather than dropping them. A record that
quietly loses answers is worse than one that shows a question the practice has
since retired.

## 4. Two-tier notes with supervisory co-signature

**The problem.** Two classes of note with rules that deliberately do not nest.
The supervisor who must countersign an associate's progress note must never read
that associate's process notes. The practice manager who can break glass into a
session note cannot break glass into a process note.

**The design.** Separate resources, separate rules, one signature workflow. A
progress note goes `draft → signed → cosigned`, where the last step exists only
when the author works under supervision. Whether it does is
`requiresCoSignature(role)` in the auth module — not a role comparison in the
notes service, and not a permission. Modelling it as a permission was the
intuitive wrong answer: an associate writes and signs exactly what a therapist
does, which is why the two share an identical matrix row.

**Immutability at two layers.** The service turns the edit affordance into an
amendment once a note is signed; a database trigger refuses a content change
even if the service is bypassed, and refuses a return to draft. Amendments are
append-only by the same trigger function as the audit log, because they are the
correction mechanism and a rewritable correction is not one.

**Process notes filter on `authorId` in SQL as well as passing the permission
check.** That is not belt-and-braces for its own sake: the check protects the
endpoint, and the filter protects every caller written later by somebody who has
not read this file. Tests assert the absence directly — that a process note
never appears in the progress-note list, the co-sign queue, or any other
clinician's list.

**The decision this forced.** Building the client record surfaced an
incoherence. The co-sign queue shows a supervisor the client's name, because you
cannot countersign a note without knowing whose it is — but the matrix as first
written denied that same supervisor the client's record. They could countersign
blind.

Two readings were available. The literal one: the PRD enumerates supervisor
access for `progress_note` and nowhere else, so deny. The one taken: supervision
is clinical responsibility rather than a signature, so a supervisor's reach over
a supervisee's caseload matches the supervisee's — with exactly one exception,
`process_note`, which stays `author`.

The second is better, and not only because it makes the workflow usable. It
makes the asymmetry *sharper*. A supervisor who could see nothing would meet an
ordinary "not your client" wall. A supervisor who can read the record, the fee,
the attendance, the screeners and the progress notes — and who has just
countersigned one — meets a locked panel directly beneath it, for the one thing
that is never theirs. That is the design's whole argument in a single screen.

## 5. The superbill

A superbill is the receipt a client hands their own insurer when the practice
does not bill insurance directly. It needs dates of service, a CPT code per
session, the fee paid, and who rendered it.

The interesting part was how little of it was new. `chargeFeeCents` was already
written onto the appointment when the session completed, for the late-cancel
fee logic — which means the fee *at the time of service* was already on the
record, and the export never has to ask what the client's fee is today. A
superbill built from today's fee would quietly misstate a session from six
months ago, and nothing in the document would show it.

The CPT code is derived, not entered. `90791` for an intake, `90834` for a
fifty-minute hour, `90837` for an extended one, `95` and place-of-service `02`
when it was delivered over video. The two ways to get that wrong — upcoding a
short session, or billing an office code for a telehealth one — are both fraud,
and neither should be reachable by a dropdown on an export screen.

Missed sessions are excluded in the pure function rather than the query. A
no-show carries a fee and belongs on the client's *statement*, but no insurer
reimburses one, and a superbill that lists one is a conversation with a payer.

**Two guards, not one.** The document is a fee record and a set of demographics
at the same time, so `buildSuperbill` passes through the matrix twice and logs
both reads. That was not extra ceremony — it made the access question answer
itself. Front desk may produce one, because they already hold both. The
treating clinician may, for their own client. The practice manager may not,
without break-glass, because their demographics access *is* break-glass and
billing is not an exception carved out of it.

**What it deliberately does not do.** There is no diagnosis code, because
Clearpath does not model diagnoses, and a superbill without one is not
claimable. The export says so on itself rather than looking complete and being
rejected at the payer. Inventing an ICD-10 field to fill the hole would have
been the worst available outcome: a document that looks submittable, produced
by software with no clinical vocabulary behind it.

## Decisions log

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| `process_note` and `progress_note` as separate resources, not one with a flag | A flag invites scattered `if (note.private)`; separate resources put the difference in the policy table where it is testable |
| `can()` returns a `Decision`, not a boolean | The audit log needs the rule that fired and whether break-glass was open; a boolean forces every call site to re-derive it |
| A `client` role in the matrix, empty on purpose | A tokenized submission gets an honest actor in the audit trail instead of being attributed to staff |
| Supervisor reach extends to a supervisee's caseload, except process notes | Countersigning blind is not supervision; the single exception is sharper against a full record than against an empty one |
| Denials logged outside the caller's transaction | A rolled-back request must still leave the attempt on the record |
| List reads logged once, not once per row | Forty audit rows for one page view buries the individual record opens that matter |
| `may()` is silent | Deciding which buttons to draw is not an access event, and logging it would drown the real ones |
| A separate `messagingName` on practice settings | "Stillwater Counseling" on a lock screen tells a roommate what the appointment is for; the deny-list catches exactly that, so the practice needs a short name |
| Dark mode follows the OS, with no in-app toggle | One less piece of state to get out of sync, and the OS already knows it is 9pm |
| TRUNCATE still permitted on the audit table | Blocking UPDATE and DELETE stops every rewrite an application bug or a hand-run query could perform; wiping the whole table is an obviously administrative act, and tests need it. Real tamper-evidence needs the log shipped off the box — claimed nowhere |
| The two hard rules that grep can check are tests, and they scan `app/` too | The role-check lint scanned only `src/`, so the layer the rule actually names — endpoints, loaders, components — was unguarded; the clock rule had no test at all. Both now fail on a planted violation, which is the only reason to trust a lint |
| Seven type steps, not twelve | The app had improvised sizes from 9.5px to 22px — nobody could tell 12px from 12.5px on purpose. The workhorse stays at 13px so the dense clinical tables did not move, and a test refuses any new arbitrary pixel value |
| `--on-solid` instead of white on solid fills | In dark mode the danger and private fills are light, and white on them fails contrast. Four buttons had hardcoded `#fff`; a solid button is the one place the foreground cannot be inherited |
| The mark is the tier model | Three rings — operational, clinical, private — and a path that comes in from outside and stops before the core. It is the product's argument at 16px, and it costs one colour |
| The style guide imports the components rather than redrawing them | A guide that redraws its specimens starts lying in week one. `/design` renders the real primitives reading the real tokens, so it is wrong only when the app is wrong |
| The integration suite runs on a 20s test timeout, not vitest's 5s | The per-test `TRUNCATE` and the ten-racer booking test are both dominated by WAL fsync, which moves with whatever else the machine is doing: the race asserted correctly on every run and still timed out on one run in four. An alarm that fires on disk latency instead of on a broken invariant trains you to rerun it, which is how a real failure gets waved through |
| The author-only rule gets a structural lint, not just behavioural tests | The suite proved the helpers that exist refuse the wrong reader. It could not say anything about the helper written next month: a `processNote` query that filters by client and forgets the author passes every existing test, because none of them call it. The lint reads the shape of the call instead — `authorId` must appear inside the query, which is the difference between filtering in SQL and filtering in JS. Two read-backs that had leaned on a preceding author-filtered `updateMany` now filter for themselves, so the rule has no exceptions to remember |
| The superbill reads the fee stored on the appointment, not the client's fee today | The completion transition already recorded what the session cost, for the late-cancel logic. Billing a March session at September's sliding-scale rate is wrong in a way no reader of the document could detect |
| Booking takes a per-slot advisory lock before it inserts | The exclusion constraints make a double-booking impossible but they do not make a *rejection* truthful: outside a lock, `23P01` means either "that room is booked" or "someone is part-way through booking it and may roll back", and ten concurrent bookings of one hour therefore all walk past a room that ends up empty. Measured at three runs in forty. Inside the lock a conflict is a committed conflict, the deadlock storm disappears with the shared lock ordering, and 150 rounds pass in 7s where 40 used to take minutes |
| Producing a superbill needs both the fee and the demographics permission | It is both records at once. Guarding it twice meant no new matrix row and no new question: whoever may already see both halves may produce it, and the practice manager still has to break glass, because billing is not a carve-out from the rule that their clinical reach is logged |

## What this project deliberately is not

It is a learning project on synthetic data. It applies HIPAA-inspired principles
because they are good engineering discipline, and it is not HIPAA-compliant
software. There is no authentication — the dev switcher is the seam where it
would go, and *authorization* is the part built for real. There is no billing,
no video, no group sessions, and no longitudinal screener analytics, the last of
which is a deliberate omission rather than a missing feature: a trend line on
somebody's depression score is a design problem before it is an engineering one.
