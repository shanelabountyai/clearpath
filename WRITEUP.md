# Clearpath — build notes

Kept as the work happens, not reconstructed afterwards.

## Core learning artifacts

1. **RBAC with sensitivity tiers** — two classes of clinical note with
   different, deliberately asymmetric rules.
2. **Recurring dual-resource scheduling with a conditional resource** — clinician
   + room, except telehealth needs no room.
3. **Scored dynamic forms with risk thresholds** — versioned templates, scoring
   rules that version with them, critical items that alert regardless of total.
4. **Two-tier notes with supervisory co-signature.**
5. **The superbill** — a claim document assembled entirely from records that
   already existed, and honest about the one it cannot supply.
6. **Screener trends** — the feature whose design is mostly refusals.
7. **Group sessions** — a plural booking of a singular appointment, paid for
   with two exclusion constraints instead of a rewrite.
8. **The client portal** — a door sized to what a leaked link would disclose.
9. **Where authentication would attach** — the one feature whose right build
   was not building it.

## 1. RBAC with sensitivity tiers

**The problem.** Access in a counseling practice is not a ladder. A supervisor
outranks an associate on the official record — they must co-sign it — and has
*less* access than that associate to the associate's private process notes,
where the answer is never. A practice manager administers the whole business and
cannot read a session note without breaking glass, and cannot read a process note
even then. Any model where "more senior" implies "sees more" gets this wrong.

**The design.** One declarative `MATRIX: role × resource × action → rule`. Cells
absent from the matrix deny. Rules are five named predicates over the actor and
the *relationships* of the thing being touched (`author`, `authorOrSupervisor`,
`supervisorOfAuthor`, `treating`, `breakGlass`); relationships are resolved from
data by the caller, so reassigning an associate's supervisor in the database
immediately reroutes both read access and the co-sign queue with no code change.

Two decisions worth naming:

- **`process_note` and `progress_note` are separate resources, not one resource
  with a sensitivity flag.** A flag invites `if (note.private)` checks scattered
  across call sites; separate resources put the difference in the policy table
  where it is visible and testable. The supervisor's row reads
  `progress_note: { cosign: ... }` next to `process_note: { read: 'author' }` —
  the asymmetry is legible at a glance.
- **`can()` returns a `Decision`, not a boolean.** It carries which rule fired
  and whether the actor was in a break-glass session, because the audit log
  needs both, and denials must be logged as richly as grants. A boolean would
  have forced every call site to re-derive that context.

**Front desk is modelled by resource, not by field.** "Sees the calendar but not
why anyone is there" could be a field-level projection on a client record; it is
instead separate resources (`client` vs `form_submission`, `form_request` vs
`form_submission`, `attendance_history` split out from `client`). Field-level
redaction is a filter you can forget to apply. A missing matrix cell is a 403.

**What it does not do.** No hierarchy, no role inheritance, no per-record ACLs,
no delegation. `associate` and `therapist` share an identical matrix — the
co-signature requirement is a workflow gate in the note state machine, not a
permission — and modelling it as a permission would have been the intuitive
wrong answer.

**Test approach.** All 455 cells are enumerated and asserted, but the expected
policy is hand-written from the PRD rather than read back off the matrix, so the
suite cannot agree with a wrong edit. Each cell is probed three ways: an actor
holding every relationship *and* break-glass, an actor who supervises the author
but wrote nothing, and an actor with no relationship at all. That last probe is
what proves which permissions are unconditional.

## 2. Recurring dual-resource scheduling with a conditional resource

**The problem.** A counseling practice runs on standing appointments: the same
client, the same clinician, the same hour, every week, for months. Each instance
needs a clinician *and* a therapy room, reserved together or not at all — except
when it does not, because a telehealth session needs no room and must not be
blocked by a full room map. So: recurrence, two resources, one of them
conditional, and no double-booking of either.

**The design.**

*Booking is decided by Postgres, not by application code.* Two `EXCLUDE USING
gist` constraints — one on `(clinicianId, tstzrange(startAt, endAt))`, one on
`(roomId, …)`, both filtered to non-cancelled rows — make the insert itself the
check. Room selection is then optimistic: pick a candidate, insert, and on a
room collision (`23P01`) try the next room; on a *clinician* collision stop,
because there is no second clinician to fall through to. A read-then-write
availability check cannot be made safe against a concurrent booking of the last
room, and every attempt to make it safe just moves the window. The race suite
puts ten simultaneous bookings against four rooms and asserts exactly four
commit.

*The conditional resource is a database invariant.* A `CHECK` constraint says
in-person requires a room and telehealth forbids one. It is not an application
habit that a future endpoint can forget.

*Recurrence stores local wall time, never a UTC instant plus seven days.* A
standing Tuesday 3pm is 3pm in March and 3pm in November. Patterns hold a
weekday and minutes-from-midnight; each occurrence converts separately through a
two-pass zoned conversion. `src/time.test.ts` asserts the hour either side of
both DST transitions, and the scheduling suite asserts it again through the
database.

**The bug worth writing down.** Idempotency first keyed on the date the
appointment sits on. Every test passed. Then: reschedule an instance from
Tuesday to Thursday, run the horizon again, and the planner sees an unfilled
Tuesday and books over the slot the client just moved out of. The unique index
on the occurrence key caught it — which is the index doing its job and the
planner failing at its own.

The fix was to separate two things the first design had conflated: **the slot in
the series an instance fills** (fixed at creation, recovered from the occurrence
key) and **where the appointment currently is** (whatever a reschedule made it).
Idempotency keys on the first; withdrawal-on-pattern-change looks at the second.

**What it does not do.** No arbitrary RRULE — weekly and biweekly are what a
practice actually books, and a full recurrence grammar would be a week spent on
a case nobody has. No automatic rescheduling around a clinician's absence: that
produces a work-list for a person, because moving somebody's standing hour is a
conversation, not a write.

---

## 3. Scored forms with versioned rules and risk thresholds

**The problem.** Intake, consent and screeners are data, so a practice manager
can revise them without a deploy. But a screener that has been answered is a
clinical record: revising the instrument must not re-score or re-render what
somebody already completed. And a screener can contain a question whose answer
needs a clinician *today*, whatever the total says.

**The design.** A submission binds to a template *version*, and publishing a
revision creates a new row rather than mutating the old one. There is
deliberately no edit-in-place: that is the single operation that would silently
rewrite history. Scoring rules version with the template, so a v1 response is
always scored by v1 rules.

Two independent paths to review:

- **Thresholds** on the total, with the practice's concern line marked `alert`.
- **Critical items**, which flag regardless of total. Somebody can answer every
  other question at zero, score 1, land in the "minimal" band, and still need a
  call. A design where severity is a single number cannot express that, which is
  why the two paths are separate rather than one weighted score.

A flagged submission raises **one alert to one person** — the treating clinician
— in the same transaction as the submission itself. A scored screener that
half-saved is a client who answered a question about self-harm into a void.

**Reason codes, never content.** The scorer emits `critical:item_9`, not the
answer and not the score. Those strings travel to the alert, the review queue
and the audit log, so anything readable in them is effectively published to
every surface that shows a flag. The wording a clinician reads is assembled at
the very edge, in the alerts page, and is never stored or logged.

**Conditional fields resolve by repeated passes**, so a field revealed by
another conditional field disappears when its parent does. A single-pass filter
leaves orphans visible, which is how a form ends up demanding an answer to a
question it is no longer showing. Only visible fields are scored, so a branch
the client opened and then closed cannot inflate a risk score — and the server
rejects an answer to a hidden question outright, because the form is a trust
boundary.

**Retired questions keep their answers.** Rendering a v1 submission against v2
surfaces them as labelled orphans rather than dropping them. A record that
quietly loses answers is worse than one that shows a question the practice has
since retired.

---

## 4. Two-tier notes with supervisory co-signature

**The problem.** Two classes of note with rules that deliberately do not nest.
The supervisor who must countersign an associate's progress note must never read
that associate's process notes. The practice manager who can break glass into a
session note cannot break glass into a process note.

**The design.** Separate resources, separate rules, one signature workflow. A
progress note goes `draft → signed → cosigned`, where the last step exists only
when the author works under supervision. Whether it does is
`requiresCoSignature(role)` in the auth module — not a role comparison in the
notes service, and not a permission. Modelling it as a permission was the
intuitive wrong answer: an associate writes and signs exactly what a therapist
does, which is why the two share an identical matrix row.

**Immutability at two layers.** The service turns the edit affordance into an
amendment once a note is signed; a database trigger refuses a content change
even if the service is bypassed, and refuses a return to draft. Amendments are
append-only by the same trigger function as the audit log, because they are the
correction mechanism and a rewritable correction is not one.

**Process notes filter on `authorId` in SQL as well as passing the permission
check.** That is not belt-and-braces for its own sake: the check protects the
endpoint, and the filter protects every caller written later by somebody who has
not read this file. Tests assert the absence directly — that a process note
never appears in the progress-note list, the co-sign queue, or any other
clinician's list.

**The decision this forced.** Building the client record surfaced an
incoherence. The co-sign queue shows a supervisor the client's name, because you
cannot countersign a note without knowing whose it is — but the matrix as first
written denied that same supervisor the client's record. They could countersign
blind.

Two readings were available. The literal one: the PRD enumerates supervisor
access for `progress_note` and nowhere else, so deny. The one taken: supervision
is clinical responsibility rather than a signature, so a supervisor's reach over
a supervisee's caseload matches the supervisee's — with exactly one exception,
`process_note`, which stays `author`.

The second is better, and not only because it makes the workflow usable. It
makes the asymmetry *sharper*. A supervisor who could see nothing would meet an
ordinary "not your client" wall. A supervisor who can read the record, the fee,
the attendance, the screeners and the progress notes — and who has just
countersigned one — meets a locked panel directly beneath it, for the one thing
that is never theirs. That is the design's whole argument in a single screen.

---

## 5. The superbill

A superbill is the receipt a client hands their own insurer when the practice
does not bill insurance directly. It needs dates of service, a CPT code per
session, the fee paid, and who rendered it.

The interesting part was how little of it was new. `chargeFeeCents` was already
written onto the appointment when the session completed, for the late-cancel
fee logic — which means the fee *at the time of service* was already on the
record, and the export never has to ask what the client's fee is today. A
superbill built from today's fee would quietly misstate a session from six
months ago, and nothing in the document would show it.

The CPT code is derived, not entered. `90791` for an intake, `90834` for a
fifty-minute hour, `90837` for an extended one, `95` and place-of-service `02`
when it was delivered over video. The two ways to get that wrong — upcoding a
short session, or billing an office code for a telehealth one — are both fraud,
and neither should be reachable by a dropdown on an export screen.

Missed sessions are excluded in the pure function rather than the query. A
no-show carries a fee and belongs on the client's *statement*, but no insurer
reimburses one, and a superbill that lists one is a conversation with a payer.

**Two guards, not one.** The document is a fee record and a set of demographics
at the same time, so `buildSuperbill` passes through the matrix twice and logs
both reads. That was not extra ceremony — it made the access question answer
itself. Front desk may produce one, because they already hold both. The
treating clinician may, for their own client. The practice manager may not,
without break-glass, because their demographics access *is* break-glass and
billing is not an exception carved out of it.

**What it deliberately does not do.** There is no diagnosis code, because
Clearpath does not model diagnoses, and a superbill without one is not
claimable. The export says so on itself rather than looking complete and being
rejected at the payer. Inventing an ICD-10 field to fill the hole would have
been the worst available outcome: a document that looks submittable, produced
by software with no clinical vocabulary behind it.

---

## 6. Screener trends, and what a chart claims

Plotting somebody's screener totals over time is four lines of code and the
most ethically loaded surface in the project. Nearly all the design here is
refusal.

**A scoring revision breaks the line.** Rules version with the template — that
was already true, and it is what makes this feature dangerous. Two totals scored
under different versions of an instrument are not two measurements of the same
thing, so the change between them is `null`, not a number. Draw them as a
continuous line and a rules edit renders as clinical movement, in the direction
whoever edited the rules happened to push it. This is the one place where the
versioning work done for P0-6 pays off in a way that was not obvious when it was
built: the trend could not have been made honest without it.

**One instrument per series.** Points group by template key. A depression total
and a sleep total on one axis is a chart that means nothing and looks like it
means something.

**It reports, it does not conclude.** No slope, no projection, no "improving" or
"deteriorating" flag. A number going down is not a person getting better —
it is nine self-reported answers on a Tuesday — and software that says otherwise
gets believed, by clinicians under time pressure and eventually by whoever else
sees the screen.

**It is its own page.** The obvious build was a panel on the client record. It
is a separate route reached by an explicit link, because a longitudinal chart of
somebody's mental state is not something to meet while scrolling for their phone
number. Asking for it is a deliberate act, and it is logged as one.

**Who can see it.** `form_submission`, which no non-clinical role holds at all.
Front desk cannot reach it; neither can the practice manager, and unlike
demographics or progress notes, break-glass does not open it. There is no
emergency that is answered by a chart of somebody's screener history. That
falls out of the existing matrix without a new rule, which is the second time
this project got a hard question answered by a table it had already written.

The query deliberately does not select `answers`. A trend is a list of totals,
and reaching for the responses to draw it would pull content the surface has no
use for.

---

## 7. Group sessions

The requirement reads "one appointment, N clients", and building it that way
would have been the expensive mistake.

An appointment carrying a list of clients means every path that asks "whose
appointment is this?" has to learn to ask "which attendee?" — the progress note,
the fee at completion, the attendance count, the audit row, the client record,
the continuity queue, the superbill. All of those are about a *person*, not
about an hour, and none of them wanted to change.

So the appointment stays singular and the *booking* becomes plural: a group
session is N appointment rows sharing a `groupSessionId`, one per attendee. Six
people, six notes, six fees, six audit rows, and not one existing query touched.
Attendance-level notes — the part the requirement called out as the hard bit —
came for free, because they were never anything other than what the system
already did.

**What it cost was two constraints.** The clinician and room exclusion
constraints see six rows with the same clinician in the same room at the same
time, which is precisely the double-booking they exist to reject. Adding the
group key as a third excluded column fixes it:

```sql
EXCLUDE USING gist (
  "clinicianId" WITH =,
  (COALESCE("groupSessionId", id)) WITH <>,
  tstzrange("startAt", "endAt", '[)') WITH &&
)
```

Two rows now conflict only if they share the resource, overlap in time, *and*
belong to different bookings. The `COALESCE` is the load-bearing part and the
easy thing to get wrong: with a bare `"groupSessionId" WITH <>`, two ordinary
appointments both have NULL there, `NULL <> NULL` is NULL rather than true, and
the constraint silently stops rejecting anything at all. Falling back to the
row's own id gives every non-group row a key unique to itself, so it still
differs from every other row and the original behaviour is exactly preserved.
A constraint that fails open is worse than no constraint, because the tests
that covered it keep passing.

**Leaving a group is moving out of the hour.** Rescheduling an attendee clears
their group key. Keeping it would let two attendees be rescheduled onto the same
new time and double-book the clinician, since co-attendees are deliberately
exempt from the overlap rule — the exemption has to end where the shared hour
does.

**Cancelling the group cancels six appointments, not one event.** Each goes
through the ordinary cancellation, so each attendee is judged against the
late-cancel window on their own. The practice calling off a group and one client
dropping out of it are different events, and the fee logic already knew that.

**On the calendar it is one chip.** Drawn literally, six attendees are six chips
stacked on the same pixels — which is what a double-booking looks like. Front
desk sees one hour with six people in it and opens the roster from there.

The audit door grew one function for this: `guardedAll`, which nests the guard
once per client record so a booking that writes to six records leaves six rows,
each naming its own client, in the same transaction as the appointments.

---

## 8. The client portal

A client gets a link to their own schedule. The design question is not what to
show them — it is what a forwarded link discloses.

Because there is no login, holding the link *is* the authentication, which is
exactly as strong as the email it arrived in. That is not a reason to refuse to
build it; the form door already made this trade and made it well. It is a reason
to size what is behind it to what you would accept leaking. So the portal shows
when you are coming in, with whom, and whether it is video or a room. Not a
note, not a score, not a fee, not a form, not their record, and not the
appointment *type* — "intake" versus "extended" is a clinical shape, and it is
on the messaging deny-list for the same reason it is absent here.

**The reschedule request carries a reason code, not a message.** This is the
decision I would defend hardest. A free-text box on a client-facing page is a
channel by which a client can write clinical content — "I can't come, the panic
attacks are back" — to the one desk in the practice that must never see it.
Nothing in the code would be wrong; the front-desk work list would faithfully
display exactly what the client typed. So there is no box. Four codes, and front
desk phones them. The conversation that needs to happen is not this system's to
hold, and building somewhere to put it would have quietly made front desk a
clinical surface.

**It requests; it never books.** Same rule as the waitlist, and the same reason:
a client silently moving their own session means nobody notices the client who
moves it every week, and that pattern is clinical information the practice needs
to see.

**A request is idempotent while it is open.** Pressing the button twice is one
request, not two, because the second one is a person who is not sure the first
worked — not new information.

**The token names nothing.** Twenty-four random bytes, no client id, no name, no
readable structure. An unknown token and another client's appointment id both
produce the same not-found, so the door cannot be used to learn whether somebody
is a client here.

Opening it is audit-logged with the client as the actor and `token` as the rule,
exactly like a form submission. The `client` role that P0-1 put in the matrix
"empty on purpose, so a submission has an honest actor" now has a second use it
was not built for, which is usually the sign a boundary was drawn in the right
place.

---

## 9. Where authentication would attach

The last P2 item is two-factor auth for clinical roles, and the right build was
not to build it.

There is no authentication in Clearpath. Adding a login that always succeeds,
or a TOTP field seeded with a fixed secret, would not have taught anything about
access control — it would have added a thing that *looks* like a security
control to a project whose entire argument is that its access control is real.
A check that cannot fail is worse than an absent one, because it reads as
present.

What did get built is the part that is genuinely this project's business: the
**policy**. `requiresSecondFactor(role)` sits in `permissions.ts` beside
`requiresCoSignature`, because which roles need a second factor is a
role-derived rule and that file is where every role-derived rule lives. An
identity provider attached later reads it; it does not restate it, and there is
no second place for the two answers to disagree.

The line is drawn by capability rather than job title. The three clinical roles
reach notes. Front desk does not, and their credential is worth a list of names
and times. The practice manager is on the list despite not being a clinical
role at all, because break-glass makes theirs the most valuable credential in
the building: a stolen admin session is one typed reason away from a client's
record, and the audit log would record that access faithfully, as them. The
break-glass design that makes admin access *visible* is exactly what makes
admin credentials *worth stealing*, and those are the same sentence.

`Session` carries `secondFactor: { required, satisfied }` where `satisfied` is
always false and nothing reads it — the seam, named, in the type. And the person
picker marks those roles "2FA seam" with the reason, so the gap is visible in
the product to anyone who opens it, rather than in a comment in a file nobody
opens.

## Decisions log

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| `process_note` and `progress_note` as separate resources, not one with a flag | A flag invites scattered `if (note.private)`; separate resources put the difference in the policy table where it is testable |
| `can()` returns a `Decision`, not a boolean | The audit log needs the rule that fired and whether break-glass was open; a boolean forces every call site to re-derive it |
| A `client` role in the matrix, empty on purpose | A tokenized submission gets an honest actor in the audit trail instead of being attributed to staff |
| Supervisor reach extends to a supervisee's caseload, except process notes | Countersigning blind is not supervision; the single exception is sharper against a full record than against an empty one |
| Denials logged outside the caller's transaction | A rolled-back request must still leave the attempt on the record |
| List reads logged once, not once per row | Forty audit rows for one page view buries the individual record opens that matter |
| `may()` is silent | Deciding which buttons to draw is not an access event, and logging it would drown the real ones |
| A separate `messagingName` on practice settings | "Stillwater Counseling" on a lock screen tells a roommate what the appointment is for; the deny-list catches exactly that, so the practice needs a short name |
| Dark mode follows the OS, with no in-app toggle | One less piece of state to get out of sync, and the OS already knows it is 9pm |
| TRUNCATE still permitted on the audit table | Blocking UPDATE and DELETE stops every rewrite an application bug or a hand-run query could perform; wiping the whole table is an obviously administrative act, and tests need it. Real tamper-evidence needs the log shipped off the box — claimed nowhere |
| The two hard rules that grep can check are tests, and they scan `app/` too | The role-check lint scanned only `src/`, so the layer the rule actually names — endpoints, loaders, components — was unguarded; the clock rule had no test at all. Both now fail on a planted violation, which is the only reason to trust a lint |
| Seven type steps, not twelve | The app had improvised sizes from 9.5px to 22px — nobody could tell 12px from 12.5px on purpose. The workhorse stays at 13px so the dense clinical tables did not move, and a test refuses any new arbitrary pixel value |
| `--on-solid` instead of white on solid fills | In dark mode the danger and private fills are light, and white on them fails contrast. Four buttons had hardcoded `#fff`; a solid button is the one place the foreground cannot be inherited |
| The mark is the tier model | Three rings — operational, clinical, private — and a path that comes in from outside and stops before the core. It is the product's argument at 16px, and it costs one colour |
| The style guide imports the components rather than redrawing them | A guide that redraws its specimens starts lying in week one. `/design` renders the real primitives reading the real tokens, so it is wrong only when the app is wrong |
| The integration suite runs on a 20s test timeout, not vitest's 5s | The per-test `TRUNCATE` and the ten-racer booking test are both dominated by WAL fsync, which moves with whatever else the machine is doing: the race asserted correctly on every run and still timed out on one run in four. An alarm that fires on disk latency instead of on a broken invariant trains you to rerun it, which is how a real failure gets waved through |
| The author-only rule gets a structural lint, not just behavioural tests | The suite proved the helpers that exist refuse the wrong reader. It could not say anything about the helper written next month: a `processNote` query that filters by client and forgets the author passes every existing test, because none of them call it. The lint reads the shape of the call instead — `authorId` must appear inside the query, which is the difference between filtering in SQL and filtering in JS. Two read-backs that had leaned on a preceding author-filtered `updateMany` now filter for themselves, so the rule has no exceptions to remember |
| The superbill reads the fee stored on the appointment, not the client's fee today | The completion transition already recorded what the session cost, for the late-cancel logic. Billing a March session at September's sliding-scale rate is wrong in a way no reader of the document could detect |
| Booking takes a per-slot advisory lock before it inserts | The exclusion constraints make a double-booking impossible but they do not make a *rejection* truthful: outside a lock, `23P01` means either "that room is booked" or "someone is part-way through booking it and may roll back", and ten concurrent bookings of one hour therefore all walk past a room that ends up empty. Measured at three runs in forty. Inside the lock a conflict is a committed conflict, the deadlock storm disappears with the shared lock ordering, and 150 rounds pass in 7s where 40 used to take minutes |
| A trend refuses to compute a change across a template version | Scoring rules version with the template, so totals either side of a revision measure different things. A line drawn through them renders a rules edit as clinical movement |
| Screener trends live on their own page, not on the client record | A chart of somebody's mental state over time should not be something you meet while looking for their phone number. Reaching it is a deliberate navigation, and the read is logged as one |
| A group session is N appointments sharing a key, not one appointment with N clients | Notes, fees, attendance, audit rows and the superbill are all about a person rather than an hour. Keeping the appointment singular meant none of them changed, and attendance-level notes needed no work at all |
| The group key enters the exclusion constraints as `COALESCE(groupSessionId, id)` | A bare `groupSessionId WITH <>` compares NULL to NULL for every pair of ordinary appointments, which is NULL rather than true, so the constraint would stop rejecting anything and every existing test would still pass. Falling back to the row's own id keeps individual bookings conflicting |
| Rescheduling an attendee clears their group key | The exemption that lets co-attendees share a clinician has to end where the shared hour does, or two rescheduled attendees can land on each other |
| The portal's reschedule request is a reason code, with no free-text field | A message box on a client-facing page is a channel for clinical content to arrive at the one desk that must never see it. Front desk phones them; that conversation is not this system's to hold |
| The portal shows no appointment type | "Intake" and "extended" describe a clinical shape. It is on the messaging deny-list for the same reason, and a leaked link should disclose times, not care |
| 2FA is a tested policy function and a named seam, not an implementation | A login that always succeeds is worse than no login, because it reads as a control. What belongs here is which roles need one, and that is a role-derived rule, so it lives beside every other role-derived rule |
| The practice manager needs a second factor despite not being a clinical role | Break-glass is one typed reason from a record, and the log would record it faithfully as them. The design that makes their access visible is what makes their credential worth stealing |
| The README's screenshots are captured by a spec, not taken by hand | A hand-taken screenshot is a claim about the product on the day someone remembered to take it. `npm run shots` drives the real build against the seeded practice, so a picture that has gone stale is a spec that fails to find what it is pointing at |
| Producing a superbill needs both the fee and the demographics permission | It is both records at once. Guarding it twice meant no new matrix row and no new question: whoever may already see both halves may produce it, and the practice manager still has to break glass, because billing is not a carve-out from the rule that their clinical reach is logged |
| A token read as `var(--status-${x})` is invisible to every search for it | The cleanup pass deleted eight status colours as dead after grepping the codebase for their names. They are built dynamically in `AppointmentChip`, so nothing ever spells one out, and the calendar lost its status edge silently — no test failed, because no test asserts a colour. What caught it was the screenshot spec: the calendar capture came back stable across runs but different from the committed one. That is the argument for screenshots being a spec rather than a picture, and the reason dynamic token construction now says so in a comment at the definition |
| Nine list pages rendered their refusals as crashes | The record pages caught `Forbidden` and showed a panel; the list pages never did, so any role could reach a 500 by typing a URL — `/audit` as a supervisor, `/clients` as the auditor, `/book` as the practice manager. Every permission decision was correct and every denial was audit-logged. The failure was in the last inch, which is the worst place for it in a project whose argument is that refusal is a designed, visible outcome rather than a fault. `withDenial` wraps the whole component rather than one query, because these pages fetch twice — a list, then the names to label it with — and a `try` around the first leaves the second free to throw past it |
| The denial spec walks the route tree instead of naming routes | Eight pages were found by hand and the ninth, `/book/group`, was found by the spec on its first run — a page nobody thought to open. Enumerating routes would have encoded the same blind spot the bug came from: each of the eight was written *after* the pattern that would have saved it, and a list of names cannot cover the page written next month. Reading `app/(staff)` from disk means a new page is covered the day it lands, which is the same reason the role-check and author-only rules are lints over the tree rather than tests over a list |
| Deploying meant admitting the demo needs a cloud database | Two guards refused one outright — `prisma.config.ts` for the CLI, `src/db.ts` for the running app — and the second would have taken the site down on its first request rather than at build time. The exemption is a named variable rather than a hostname allow-list, set by the Vercel build and the two `:prod` scripts and nothing else, because the case worth walling off is the accident: a mistyped `.env.test` pointing a sweep at a cloud branch, which never announces itself. The deployed practice is the same seeded fiction as `npm run db:seed` |
| The audit screenshot masks its timestamp | The three other captures are byte-identical run to run, because the seed is date-pinned; this one moved every time, and a picture that always differs teaches you to ignore the one time it differs for a reason — the same trap as a flaky test. The cause is not a defect: `AuditEvent.at` defaults to the database clock rather than the app's injected one, which is the single timestamp the application should not be able to choose. So the shot boxes the cell out instead, and the README says why |
| The telehealth lane lays its sessions out side by side | Every room column is protected by an exclusion constraint, so two chips can never collide there — and that is exactly why the collision in the one unconstrained column went unseen. The telehealth lane exists to hold as many sessions at once as the practice can staff; drawn at full width they landed on identical pixels and the last one painted won. On the seeded Monday the header said 16 sessions and two of them were underneath other chips. `toBeVisible` cannot catch it, because an element covered by another element is still visible to the DOM, so the e2e assertion is geometric: no two chips on the day may intersect. A lane holding two at once now takes the width of two rather than cutting a name in half to fit |
| A group chip's status is the roster's, not the first attendee's | The chip stands for the hour, and it was painting itself from whichever of the six rows sorted first: a group where one person no-showed rendered hatched, red, struck through and chargeable, on the runs where that row came back first. `groupStatus` takes the most-attending status instead, so a group reads as cancelled only when every attendee cancelled — which is also the only case where nobody is in the room. The recurrence marker went with it: a standing slot belongs to a person, not to the hour |
| Both queries behind the day view name a tiebreaker | `orderBy: { startAt: 'asc' }` is not an order when a practice books four rooms at 10:00 — Postgres returns the ties however it likes, and every downstream choice that reads "the first row" inherits that. The calendar screenshot moved 31,082 pixels between two runs of `npm run shots` in a fresh container and then held still for four, which is precisely the flake the audit-timestamp mask exists to avoid. The seed's history walk had the same shape and worse consequences: it draws a roll per past appointment in query order, so the quarter's statuses were a property of the physical row order rather than of the seed. The calendar tiebreaks on id; the seed tiebreaks on the client code, because ids are generated fresh on every seed and sorting by one is only as stable as the run that made it |
| The demo spec now names the note it co-signs | Making the seed deterministic gave the demo client two notes awaiting co-signature instead of one, and the capstone e2e test failed — it had asserted that co-signing emptied the queue of that client. The assertion it wanted was that *the note it signed* left the queue, and it had been passing on a coincidence of ordering. The seed's own log line was quoting the same coincidence, and now counts |
| The counts the documents quote are checked by the runs that settle them | `it('covers 455 cells', () => expect(cells).toHaveLength(ROLES.length * RESOURCES.length * ACTIONS.length))` asserted nothing: `cells` is built from exactly that product, so it agreed with itself at any size, and 455 — a number three documents quote — existed only in the test's name. The README was meanwhile claiming 1,252 tests against a suite that had grown to 1,272, the same drift a hand-correction had already fixed once. A count of the suite cannot be a test, because `it.each` generates 910 of the matrix's cases at collection time and no test can see the run it is inside; so it is a reporter on each side, vitest and Playwright, comparing the finished run to the sentence in the README. The part that matters is that a claim whose sentence has been reworded fails too — a check that quietly stops finding what it guards is the same broken thing as the assertion it replaced |
| Every check the project argues for now runs on push, not only on a laptop | The suite, two structural lints, the route-tree denial sweep and the reporters that hold the documents to their own counts were all in the repository and none of them ran anywhere but the machine of whoever remembered. A rule enforced by a test that nothing schedules is a convention again. The workflow builds the three databases the README describes, on a Postgres service container that is localhost — which is what `src/db.ts` will accept, since nothing in CI sets `CLEARPATH_ALLOW_CLOUD_DB` |
| CI runs the screenshot capture but does not compare its pixels | The spec's value is that a picture pointing at UI which no longer exists fails to find it, and that check is machine-independent. The bytes are not: a capture reproduces exactly on the machine that took it, and of the four committed images the one regenerated most recently matches this runner class byte-for-byte while the three taken earlier wrap their text a line differently. An assertion on bytes would report the font stack of whoever ran it last, which is the flaky-test failure mode this project keeps refusing elsewhere |
| The suite was audited by mutating the code, because a passing test proves nothing about the assertion inside it | `d59eadb` found one assertion that would have passed at any number, by eye. The systematic version rewrites a single token of a source file — a comparison flipped, a boolean inverted, a literal bumped — and runs the suite: a mutant that survives is behaviour no assertion pins down. 185 mutants over the pure-logic modules, 143 killed, and of the 42 survivors 7 were caught by the integration suite, which is why a survivor is re-run against the whole suite before it counts as anything. `permissions.ts` killed 51 of 53 and both survivors died in the notes and repository suites: the matrix is not a paper exercise. The gaps were all in one direction — the degenerate input. Scoring pinned every answer a client gives and nothing about the ones they leave, so a *visible but unanswered* critical item could have been made to raise a clinical alert and no test would have objected. Eleven tests now cover the blanks, and each was checked by re-applying the exact mutant it was written for and requiring the suite to go red |
| Two dayview tests asserted their rule against a shape that could not show it failing | `touching sessions do not overlap` is the right rule and its two-session fixture cannot fail: when `a` ends exactly as `b` starts, `b` reuses the track `a` freed, so the cluster is one track wide whether or not the boundary is read correctly. It takes a third session overlapping the second before reading `>=` as `>` narrows `a` to half width. Worse, `places the same sessions the same way whatever order they arrive in` compares `at(spans)` with `at(reversed)` — both sides sort with the same comparator, so it proves order-invariance and cannot prove the order is right; a comparator consistently sorting by end time instead of start satisfies it. Order-invariance and correctness are two assertions, and only one of them was being made |

## What this project deliberately is not

It is a learning project on synthetic data. It applies HIPAA-inspired principles
because they are good engineering discipline, and it is not HIPAA-compliant
software. There is no authentication — the dev switcher is the seam where it
would go, and *authorization* is the part built for real. There is no insurance
billing beyond the superbill the client claims with themselves, no video, no
diagnosis coding, and no clinician logs in from anywhere it can verify.

Screener trends and the client portal were the two things this write-up
originally listed as deliberate omissions, on the grounds that both are design
problems before they are engineering ones. They still are — which turned out to
be the argument for building them carefully rather than the argument for leaving
them out. The trend refuses to draw a line across a scoring revision or to call
a falling number recovery; the portal has no text box. Neither restraint would
have been discovered by continuing not to build them.
